                    Pilates takes its name from Joseph Pilates. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    A German-born emigr√© to Britain and then America, he devised the Pilates method as a new approach to exercise and body-conditioning in the early decades of the last century. His method included the use of equipment referred to by him as: apparatus. Perhaps the best known piece of equipment is the Pilates reformer, which is in use in the Pilates Central studio today.
